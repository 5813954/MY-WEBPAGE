		<h1>Internet Security</h1>
		<p>Internet security consists of a range of security tactics for protecting activities and transactions conducted online over the internet. These tactics are meant to safeguard users from threats such as hacking into computer systems, email addresses, or websites; malicious software that can infect and inherently damage systems; and identity theft by hackers who steal personal data such as bank account information and credit card numbers.
		<h2>What are the differences between active and passive security threats?</h2>
		<p id="attacks"><strong>Active Attacks:</strong>
		<p>Active attacks are the type of attacks in which the attacker makes an effort to <em>change or modify</em> the content of <strong>messages</strong>. Active Attack is dangerous for Integrity as well as availability. Due to active attack system is always damaged and System resources can be changed. The most important thing is that, in active attack, <strong>the victim is informed about the attack.</strong> <br>

		<br>
		<p id="attacks"><strong>Passive Attacks:</strong>
		<p>Passive Attacks are the type of attacks in which the attacker <em>observes</em> the content of messages or <em>copy</em> the content of messages. Passive Attack is dangerous for Confidentiality. Due to passive attack, there isn't any harm to the system. The most important thing is that in passive attack, the <strong>victim is not informed about the attack.</strong><br>

		<h2>Malware</h2>
		<p>Malware, short for <em>malicious software</em>, is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information.
		<p id="attacks"><strong>Types of malware</strong>
		<p> You've probably heard the words <em><strong>virus, trojan, and worm</strong></em>.But,what are them and what are their differences?
		<ul>
		<li>A <strong>worm</strong> is a standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer.
		<li>A <strong>virus</strong> is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.
		<li>A <strong>trojan</strong> is a program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades as something the user wants and tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.
		</ul>
		<p>A way to categorize malware is by what it does once it has successfully infected its victim's computers. There are a wide range of potential attack techniques used by malware:
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Spyware</strong>, defined as a malware used for the purpose of secretly gathering data on an unsuspecting user." In essence, it spies on your behavior as you use your computer, and on the data you send and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party. A <strong>keylogger</strong> is a specific kind of spyware that records all the keystrokes a user makes—great for stealing passwords.
		<li>A <strong>rootkit</strong> is a program or, more often, a collection of software tools that gives a threat actor remote access to and control over a computer or other system." It gets its name because it's a kit of tools that (generally illicitly) gain root accessover the target system, and use that power to hide their presence.
		<li>An <strong>Adware</strong> is a malware that forces your browser to redirect to web advertisements, which often themselves seek to download further, even more malicious software.
		<li><strong>Ransomware</strong> is a flavor of malware that encrypts your hard drive's files and demands a payment, usually in <em>Bitcoin</em>, in exchange for the decryption key.
		<li><strong>Cryptojacking</strong> is another way attackers can force you to supply them with Bitcoin,the difference is that it may happen without your necessarily knowledge.
		<li><strong>Malvertising</strong> is the use of legitimate ads or ad networks to covertly deliver malware to unsuspecting users’ computers. For example, a cybercriminal might pay to place an ad on a legitimate website. When a user clicks on the ad, code in the ad either redirects them to a malicious website or installs malware on their computer.
		<h3>Network Protocols</h3>
		<h5>HTTP</h5>
		<p>HTTP is an application layer protocol used for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems.HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning the client and server are only aware of each other while the connection between them is intact. After that, both the client and server forget about each other's existence. Due to this phenomenon, the client and server can't both retain information between requests.
		<h3>Network layer protocols</h3>
		<h5>IPv6</h5>
		<p>IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, a network layer protocol that possesses addressing and control information for enabling packets to be routed in the network. IPv6 was created to deal with IPv4 exhaustion. It increases the IP address size from 32 bits to 128 bits to support more levels of addressing.
		<p><strong>Advantages</strong>
		<ul>
		<li>More efficient routing and packet processing compared to IPv4.
		<li>Better security compared to IPv4.
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>
		<ul>
		<li>IPv6 is not compatible with machines that run on IPv4.
		<li>Challenge in upgrading the devices to IPv6.
		</ul>
		<h2>What is a digital certificate?</h2>
		<p>A <strong>SSL Certificate</strong> is a popular type of Digital Certificate that binds the ownership details of a web server (and website) to cryptographic keys. These keys are used in the SSL/TLS protocol to activate a secure session between a browser and the web server hosting the SSL Certificate. In order for a browser to trust an SSL Certificate, and establish an SSL/TLS session without security warnings, the SSL Certificate must contain the domain name of website using it, be issued by a trusted CA, and not have expired.Certificates come in many different formats to support not just SSL, but also authenticate people and devices, and add legitimacy to code and documents.
		<h2>How can I protect myself?</h2>
		<p>It is very advisable to contact a cybersecurity company in order to get protected of damages, you can both get informed on the several companies' websites or go to an office nearby. I will propose an idea,
