		<h1>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h1>
		<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <strong>(WCAG)</strong> are a part of the web accessibility guidelines published by the Web Accessibility Initiative part of the World Wide Web Consortium, the leading internet standards organization.
		<h2>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</h2>
		<p>The W3C project was the first achivement made by the WCAG. It date backs to the 5th May 1999. The W3C is an international community that includes a full-time staff, industry experts, and several member organizations. These groups work together to develop standards for the World Wide Web.
		The mission of the W3C is to lead the Web to its full potential by developing relevant protocols and guidelines. This is achieved primarily by creating and publishing the following Web standards divided into 3 prioriry levels:</p>
		<ol>
		<li> Provide equivalent alternatives  to auditory and visual content</li>
		<li> Do not rely on colour alone</li>
		<li> Use markup and style sheets, and do so properly</li>
		<li> Clarify natural language usage</li>
		<li> Create tables that transform gracefully</li>
		<li> Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully</li>
		<li> Ensure user control of time sensitive content changes</li>
		<li> Ensure direct accesibility of embedded user interfaces</li>
		<li> Design for device independence</li>
		<li> User interim solution</li>
		<li> Use W3C technologies and guidelines</li>
		<li> Provide context and orientation information</li>
		<li> Provide clear navigation mechanisims</li>
		<li> Ensure that documents are clear and simple</li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
		<li> <strong> 1st Priority</strong> - the most basic level of web accesibility</li>
		<li> <strong> 2nd Priority</strong> - adressed the biggest barriers for users with disabilities</li>
		<li> <strong> 3rd Priority</strong> - significant improvements to web accessibility</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</h1>
		<p>The <strong>WCAG 2.0</strong> was a W3C recommendation published on the 11th December in 2008. It is made by twelve guidelines which follow four principles, a website must be <strong>perceivable</strong>,<strong>operable</strong>,<strong>understandable</strong> and <strong>robust</strong>.
		The W3C's techniques for WCAG 2.0 provides guidance for web content authors and evaluators on meeting WCAG 2.0 success criteria.

		<p id="principles"><strong>The principles for WCAG 2.0 are:</strong> <br>
		<p id="principles2"><strong>Perceivable</strong> <br>
		<p>Information and user interface components have to be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</p>
		<ul>
		<li> <underline> Guideline 1.1</underline>:Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need,such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
		<li> <underline> Guideline 1.2 </underline>:Time-based media, provide alternatives for time based media.
		<li> <underline> Guideline 1.3 </underline>:Create content that can be presented in different ways(for example simpler layout) withot loosing information or structure.
		<li> <underline> Guideline 1.4 </underline>:Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from brackground.
		</ul>
		<p id="principles2"><strong>Operable</strong> <br>
		<p>User interface components and navigation must be operable.
		<ul>
		<li> <underline> Guideline 2.1</underline>:Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
		<li> <underline> Guideline 2.2</underline>:Provide users enough time to read and use content.
		<li> <underline> Guideline 2.3</underline>:Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.
		<li> <underline> Guideline 2.4</underline>:Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
		</ul>
		<p id="principles2"><strong>Understandable</strong> <br>
		<p>Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</p>
		<ul>
		<li> <underline> Guideline 3.1</underline>:Make text content readable and underestandable
		<li> <underline> Guideline 3.2</underline>:Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
		<li> <underline> Guideline 3.3</underline>:Help users avoid and correct mistakes.
		</ul>
		<p id="principles2"><strong>Robust</strong> <br>
		<p>Content must be robust enough so that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</p>
		<ul>
		<li> <underline> Guideline 4.1</underline>:Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
		</ul>
		<p id="criticism"><strong>Criticism of <em>WAI</em> guidelines.</p>
		<p> It has been said wÂ·C process is not suitable enough for user needs. Some companies, more accurately 40 of them, as well as several articles have criticised the WAI for having allowed WCAG 1.0 to get out of step with today's tachnologies.
