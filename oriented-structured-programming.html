		<h1>Structured programming vs object-oriented programming</h1>
		<p><em><strong>Structured programming:</strong></em> (sometimes known as modular programming) is a programming paradigm that facilitates the creation of programs with <strong>readable</strong> code and <strong>reusable</strong> components.<br>
		<em><strong>Object Oriented programming: (OOP)</strong></em> is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.

		<h3>Principles for each way of programming<h3>
		<p id="object">OOP<br>
		The four pillars of object-oriented programming are:
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Inheritance</strong>: child classes inherit data and behaviors from parent class.</li>
		<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: containing information in an object, exposing only selected information.</li>
		<li><strong>Abstraction</strong>:only exposing high level public methods for accessing an object.</li>
		<li><strong>Polymorphism</strong>:many methods can do the same task.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p id="object">Modular programming<br>
		Any program cronstruccion can be created more simply with the sequence, repetition and decision constructions that are discussed in the following sections:
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Sequence</strong>:Execute a list of statements in order.
		<li><strong>Repetition</strong>:Repeat a block of statements while a condition is true.
		<li><strong>Selection</strong>:Choose at most one action from several alternative conditions.
